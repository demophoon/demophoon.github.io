</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Recently I was asked to dig up some of the tutorials and classes that I had
used to learn Python! It was a three day course that went through
the fundamentals of the language and its real world uses with very helpful tips
and tricks a long the way. As great as any course is, you will probably not
retain some of the information that had been given to you. Maybe it was
something that the instructor had noted on but said that it would not be
covered in the class. Or it could have been something that you had been
Redditing through because it was not that important to begin with. Whatever the
case may be I highly recommend that you go back and go over the material again!
It has been a few years since I dove into the world of Python and when I was
asked to go retrieve the course that I had taken I spent a little bit of time
and reviewed the materials again. I had found that a lot of the things that the
instructor was mentioning made 1000 times more sense to me now, and I picked up
some things that I had completely missed the first time around. Now these are
not very important things to remember, which is why I chose to not retain the
information in the first place but none the less it was still new to me. So
where ever you ended up learning your language of choice, go back and review
basic concepts every once in a while. Even if that means finding a new
introductory course for the language.</p>
