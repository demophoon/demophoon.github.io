This last week I started working on a card game called Cards of Lunacy, an
online version of Cards Against Humanity(tm). It turned out to be a lot of work
getting a lot of working parts moving just right since it is my first time
playing with Websockets in this fashion. Everything worked just fine when I ran
the server on my local computer with a few people playing at the same time. I
thought I had a decent product and then I pushed it out onto my server where I
could start running it for many more people to play. Lo and behold I started
getting emails and questions as to why the game was not working and how the
hell to play the game in the first place. Thus I began my journey of fixing
anything and everything that I could find, and there was an entire mountain of
errors. Beta testing can be quite rough if you are not open to criticism but it
is a very important step. Some of the comments such as "it doesn't work." are
quite annoying when that is all the information that they give but none the
less it is a problem that you probably should investigate further unless it is
a PEBKAC error. Dig through logs until you find something and then fix it. I've
learned all of this the hard way this time around.
