This last week I spent a little bit of time looking into my options for coding
on a mobile device, like a phone or a tablet, and I found some really promising
results. Now I had tried this venture before on my Nexus 7 and a cheap
bluetooth keyboard from micro center. An app that I am sure most people have
used on this similar venture called <a
href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.connectbot&amp;hl=en"
target="_blank">ConnectBot</a> seemed like it will do the job but as soon as
you go to edit a file you realize that there is no support for Ctrl or Alt, or
any sort of modifier key for that isn't shift. I found that out when I was
trying to create/switch panes in tmux. Not being able to kill or background
programs almost makes any task near impossible, if not incredibly irritating.
Looking around on the internet I found someone that forked the ConnectBot
project and added in the missing hooks for bluetooth keyboards. The forked
project is called <a
href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sk.vx.connectbot&amp;hl=en"
target="_blank">VX ConnectBot</a>. I tested it out on my phone and Alt and
Control both work as expected. It was a bit weird working without Esc since
that has become a part of my flow with Vim. (My keyboard does not have an
escape button on it. Instead it has a lock button where escape should be that
locks my phone unless for some reason escape really does map to the sleep/wake
button on Android, in which case i'd have to get used to it.) Anyways, those
are just my findings, it will definitely give me something to do on long trips
in the car or give me a chance to do some work while I am waiting at the
laundromat.
