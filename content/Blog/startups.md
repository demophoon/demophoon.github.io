This last week I was invited to a [/r/KCTech](http://www.reddit.com/r/KCTech)
meetup and got to meet a few of the startup companies and companies that
started in the Kansas City area. It makes me feel proud to grow up in what
people are calling the silicon prairies now. I handed all of the business cards
that I had on me to be of assistance to any startup that needed a quick favor
or something, and I really do mean it to any of you that I handed cards to (and
those who I was not able to hand a card out to). I believe that what we have
here in the Kansas City area is very good and anyway I can help  us become a
more thriving area would be my honor. I definitely plan on attending more of
these local meetups because it really is nice to start moving away from the
"Looks like we are not in Kansas anymore Toto", (which to be honest I never
liked in the first place) and on to something more meaningful.
