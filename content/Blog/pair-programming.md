For some time now I had thought of pair programming as being counterintuitive.
I'm sure others out there have had the same thought process as me. For
instance, i'd have thoughts like "Wait, you're saying that TWO programmers are
going to try and share ONE computer?!? Wouldn't that just slow the process of
development down?". If you have found yourself having thoughts like this about
pair programming I challenge you to think about it in a different light. Pair
programming isn't like howÂ the BitBucket video below portrays pair programming.

Instead think about it as a way for two developers to share knowledge to one
another efficiently. While you might be losing resources and raw development
time you are gaining wisdom and knowledge at an alarming rate. During my first
weeks at Puppet Labs I had paired for the first time in, well, forever and it
was one of the most satisfying things I could have done. Instead of fumbling
around in the source code alone and by myself I was able to talk to my
co-worker who had been working on Puppet for quite a lot longer than me. I
worked real issues with him that could be seen at the end of the day in the
codebase. I even got my first pull request in on my second day on the job.
Pairing encourages you to review code that your colleagues are writing as it is
being written. I began to ask questions about why things are happening a
certain way instead of where I should even start on a problem. The where to
start on a problem was something that someone that has knowledge of all the
interconnecting parts should address and not someone that has never touched the
system before. You'd never send a rookie into the kitchen on his first day and
expect that things would just get done if he was never shown the ropes.

So next time you run into that problem that you are unable to solve try and see
if you can pair with someone that knows the problem or system and tackle it
together. Turn it into a learning experience and pick at the other person's
brain while you are at it so that next time you will be prepared for that
problem when you see it again. Or even better, next time you encounter a more
difficult problem you can take the knowledge that you acquired in the pairing
session and help show someone else the ropes as you tackle the problem
together.
