Would you rather know a lot about one specific thing or know a little about a
lot of different things. I tend to live my life geared for the latter of the
two. Learn a little bit about a lot of things and you are able to connect the
dots between the categories to synthesize actual thoughts and ideas instead of
spewing facts that we found in the back of the book going through school only
because there was only ever one answer for anything. You are better geared to
face challenges that the real life presents you. Now I'm not saying that
knowing a lot about a specific thing is bad and that these people cannot think
for their own, because I know plenty of people that know a ton of information
within their expertise, it really isn't for everyone to take that approach on
knowledge. For me, I find a lot of different things very interesting and enjoy
learning about a bunch of things. I feel like I'd be a well rounded handyman
instead of an expert anywhere.

Anyways, kind of a short post this week, not a whole lot happened outside of
work except seeing The Doctor roaming about the local Renaissance Festival,
quite entertaining in my opinion.
