</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Keeping track of the visitors that go to your website can be a very useful tool
in finding out bugs in all sorts of areas in a web application. Viewing them in
a neat and organized manner can make parsing through logs trying to figure out
what the user did to cause the error in the first place. This is exactly what I
have Google Analytics for, and if you do not know what Analytics is it is
Google's solution to tracking visitors through a website. Tracking scripts and
images can be found through out the entire internet, sometimes it is used for
advertising and other times it is used by people like me that are just curious
what kind of traffic my website generates on a day to day basis. Analytics has
a great dashboard that shows you all sorts of information that can be collected
via a small snippet of code you throw onto any page you want to track. The neat
thing is with that small snippet of code you can use it on just about any
domain or subdomain that you may own and it will store the information under
the tracking id it creates for you. I have Analytic tracking scripts on just
about everything on this website for my information only. Since Analytics has a
very nice Visitor Flow chart I am able to tell how users got to an error page
or a 404 page simply by following the arrows from left to right on the chart.
It walks me through exactly what the user went through. First the index page,
then the images page, and finally to a 404 page where then they closed the web
page and the flow chart drops off the screen. Also with my tracking id I can
plug it into my apps on the Google Chrome web store and view keywords that
people searched to get to my applications. It even allows me to see if people
are staying to download the application or if they leave right then and there.
Knowing this information can be very valuable by helping you understand what a
typical flow is for any group of users. If you have not looked into Analytics I
strongly recommend looking into it or some other form of visitor tracking. You
may be surprised with what you may find.</p>                </article>
