<p>Just joking!</p>
<p>I'll tell you what though, this has got to be my biggest downfall as a human,
staying motivated and not procrastinating and giving up early, especially on
personal projects, is something that I struggle with. Even looking at the
frequency of my blog posts over the last few months shows a steady decline in
my motivation to write. I think i'll need to come up with a calendar to track
my progress, something that is public so that the whole world can see it. The
commit graph has been one thing that has been keeping me motivated on Github.
Seeing it starting to fill in with the sweet green of daily commits keeps me
going there. I feel that the same sort of visual response will help me not
forget about this blog that I've set up here on my own website. Even HabitRPG,
a good habit tracking web app, cannot motivate me more than a few days. I
attribute some of that to the fact that I just don't want to spend the time to
log in on all of my computers and manually increment each counter after I
complete a task (that shit should be automated!) and the other part of me not
being able to use the tool is because of this fear that upon logging back into
it will reveal that I have died and lost all of my sweet hard earned progress.
I could probably come up with a million other reasons as to why I personally
shouldn't use it but I think I just need to man up and start caring about my
motivational and habitual progress. Starting now actually. I've just logged in
and just as I had expected my character has died but this is not going to
detour me this time and hopefully the next time it may happen.</p>
<p>+1 for weekly blog posts.</p>
