</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>This last week I went and wrote some new code that would help me easily hook
into <a href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>'s REST-ful API. It was very
straight forward with adding the basic authentication headers to each request
in Python which is a single line of code. After spending time and effort into
adding some basic features to the script and when I shared my code changes it
turns out that Twilio has an excellent library already written in Python that I
just needed to import this entire time. The mentality that I need to do
everything is something that I still have from school. You know, that mentality
that you are not allowed to use anyone's work as your own, and don't go looking
in the back of the book either. That is cheating. Don't get me wrong, It is
very important to have those types of rules so that you can learn how things
work in school but it is not practical in the real world. Most times you are
not going to want to write a half-assed library for authenticating users via
LDAP or what have you because chances are that has probably been done before.
Don't reinvent the wheel! It is not your goal to reinvent the wheel every time
you want to make a new vehicle. Chances are that authentication library you may
create will turn out much more complicated, cumbersome, and riddled with
watermelon sized bugs than that of a library thats sole purpose was for having
a secure login system. Anyways, before you try integrating a new feature into
one of your programs, please check and see if something similar exists on in
the wild before trying to implement it on your own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, on a slightly more personal and unrelated note, I must say that I am
sorry for the absent-ed-ness of these last few weeks of blogging. When shit
hits the fan, oh boy does it hit the fan with great strength and vigor. I won't
go into details of anything but I am definitely trying to become more
comfortable with things in my own life rather than letting it all fester and
turn into something unreasonably bigger than it is.</p>
